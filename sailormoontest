Fighting evil by moonlight
Winning love by daylight
Never running from a real fight
She is the one named Sailor Moon

She will never turn her back on a friend
She is always there to defend
She is the one on whom we can depend
She is the one named Sailor
Sailor Venus! Sailor Mercury!
Sailor Mars! Sailor Jupiter!
With secret powers all so new to her
She is the one named Sailor Moon
